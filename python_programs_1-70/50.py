#50. Take the following Python code that stores a string: ‘str = 'Y-tatata-acropolis: 0.8475'. Use find and string slicing to extract the portion 
#of the string after the colon character and then use the float function to convert the extracted string into a floating point number.

string = 'Y-tatata-acropolis: 0.8475'
col_pos = string.find(':')                  # Finds the colon character
number = string[col_pos + 1:]                 # Extracts portion after colon
confidence = float(number)                  # Converts to floating point number
print(confidence)
